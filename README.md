# Social Distancing Simulation

This is a Python project to simulate the effect of social distancing to flatten the infection curve during the global pandemic COVID-19.

## Usage

To start the simulation animation, run the command: 

Arguments: \
 --level: Percentage of the people following the social distancing rule.  \
 --release: If the infected curve starts to show signs of flattening or decreasing, all people are allowed to move freely.  \
 --save: Save the animation in directory.
 
```
python run.py --level N --release True/False --save True/False
```
